# pblci
Path-based lncRNA-cancer interactions (PBLCI) is a package to predict lncRNA-cancer interactions based on lncRNA-lncRNA similarity, disease-disease similarity, and known lncRNA-cancer interactions. 

This was created as a final project for cs2810 (Advanced Computational Molecular Biology). 

Accompanying materials will be linked soon.
